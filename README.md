# Solar wind classification

This project is a competition between all the classmates of M2 Data Science, ran on the website Ramp.studio.

The goal was to detect ICME (Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections), more often called solar storms, given time series of the magnetic field, the particle density, bulk velocity, temperature, etc. It is a binary classification task (solar storm or not) at a given time. It is very relevant to include some time series features as the observations are chronological.

Competition had two phases : 
- Individual phase : my final score was 0.21, which made me 4th of the competition (first one had 0.19)
- Collaborative phase : will be closed on the 31st of January

You'll find more information about the dataset on [this github](https://github.com/ramp-kits/solar_wind)
